# SortingTimeChecker
Hello Reader,
SortingTimeChecker is a simple app that tells you the time in seconds that a Sorting Algorithm will take to sort an unsorted array.
It populates an array inside with random numbers. You specify the array size and populate the internal array. It contains a drop down that lets
you pick a sorting algorithm that you want to use. It also contains a reset button that resets everything to their initial state.
